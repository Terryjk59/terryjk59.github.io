        <h1><strong>About Me<em>Terry</em></strong></h1>
        
        <p>
            Hello, my name is Terry. I am a freshman at URI majoring in Film and media. 
            I’m a goofy photographer trying to learn new things. I’ve worked as a freelance photographer and as a secondary photographer at an advertising firm before coming to URI, 
            now that I’m here I mostly keep my photographic work limited to my course work. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Besides being a shutter bug, I love sitting inside gaming or editing. As a photographer I’ve spent more time editing pictures than taking them.
            <br>
            Other than editing I’m also into video games. If I’m not work or editing, I’m playing video games. Other than that, I’m a pretty normal guy who likes taking pictures.
            <br>
            <br>
            Fun fact: As much as I love taking pictures and capturing moments I hate being in front of the lens, I don’t have too many pictures of myself. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            I have been taking pictures and vides for about 6 years now and still no matter how good I get there is always room to grow. For that growth I decided to learn coding… trying to at the very least. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I’d like to consider myself a bit of a movie buff but every now and then I come across someone who introduces me to some new 
            director, actor, creator or whatever and gets me into some new genre of films I never thought to explore.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            If you dear reader have some interesting film I should watch please let me know in the comment box I shall soon learn to code.
            <br>
