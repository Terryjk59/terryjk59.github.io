            Hello, my name is Terry. I am a freshman at URI majoring in Film and media. I’m a goofy photographer trying to learn new things. 
            I’ve worked as a freelance photographer and as a secondary photographer at an advertising firm before coming to URI, now that I’m here I mostly keep my photographic work limited to my course work.

Besides being a shutter bug, I love sitting inside gaming or editing. As a photographer I’ve spent more time editing pictures than taking them. 
Besides editing I’m also into video games. If I’m not work or editing, I’m playing video games. Other than that I’m a pretty normal guy who like taking pictures.
