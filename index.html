        <p class="intro">
         The following website is a virtual portfolio of all that I have and can accomplish with a little bit hard work, determination, and a whole lot of Khan academy.
            <br>
         The is the Introduction page of my website. Here I will add my own images as soon as I learn how to code that. For now, I have this image I created on PIXLR.
            <br>
         As of this moment I do not know how much I can experiment with this website and if a central theme is important or not. 
         <br>
            Till then I will update this site from time to time making new and different changes to morph this site slowly and gradually into something beautiful and presentable.
            <br>
            For now, it is a simple webpage that hosts some of my own creative works.
